# tmux-config #

Welcome to my full tmux configuration!

## Target audience ##

Anyone can use and modify my configurations in any way needed. I would only
suggest that you 1) give me credit for something interesting you find here and
2) share your changes so other could benefit from it.

That being said I would like to point out that I work as a software engineer so
most of my configurations are target for that kind of work.

## Installation ##

You can use this in any way you prefer but I would like to show you how I use
it in my machines.

1. Clone this project into `~/.config/tmux`
2. Call `~/.config/tmux/bin/tat` to start tmux

**Note:** I only tested these configurations on macOS, so use at your own risk.
